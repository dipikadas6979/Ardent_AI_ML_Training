👩‍💻 About Me
Hi, I'm Dipika Das — a passionate B.Sc (CS) student exploring the world of Python, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning. I enjoy building real-world projects that solve problems, and I'm actively learning modern AI tools including automation workflows and LLM applications.

🎓 Currently in my 2nd year at Haldia Institute of Management
🧠 Completed a hands-on AI/ML Workshop (Ardent) with live coding in Google Colab
🤖 Interested in AI, Automation, and LLMs
🌱 Mentored by SK Sahil (AI Developer & Tutor) — Code_ScholarEU
📬 Open to internships and collaborations in Python, Data Analysis & beginner ML

📂 Featured Projects
🔍 Project 1 — EDA Dashboard (Titanic Dataset)

Exploratory Data Analysis · Visual Insights · Pandas · Matplotlib

A beginner-friendly EDA project where I performed full data exploration and visualization on the Titanic dataset.
What I did:

Loaded the dataset and explored columns using Pandas
Handled missing values using mean and mode imputation
Created visualizations: survival count, gender vs survival, age distribution
Extracted and summarized key insights (presentation-ready)

Tech Stack: Pandas Matplotlib Data Cleaning EDA

🏠 Project 2 — House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

Supervised ML · scikit-learn · RMSE · R² Evaluation

My first supervised ML model that predicts house prices from training data using Linear Regression.
What I did:

Performed train-test split to evaluate model on unseen data
Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
Evaluated using RMSE and R² score
Visualized Actual vs Predicted values and residual errors

Tech Stack: scikit-learn Linear Regression RMSE R² Matplotlib
