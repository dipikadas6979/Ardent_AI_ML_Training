👩‍💻 About Me
Hi, I'm Dipika Das — a Computer Science student passionate about Python, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning. I enjoy building projects that solve real problems and learning modern AI tools.
I completed a hands-on AI/ML workshop (Ardent) and built real portfolio projects using Google Colab, pushing them to GitHub as part of my learning journey. I'm guided and mentored by SK Sahil (AI Developer & Tutor at Code_ScholarEU), who helped me understand ML basics, GitHub workflows, and portfolio building from the ground up.
I'm currently exploring:

Supervised learning and model evaluation
Basic feature engineering
Automation workflows
LLM (Large Language Model) applications

🚀 Featured Projects
📊 Project 1 — EDA Dashboard (Titanic Dataset)

Exploratory Data Analysis · Visual Insights

A beginner-friendly EDA project where I loaded a real dataset, cleaned missing values, created visualizations, and extracted meaningful insights.
What I did:

Loaded the Titanic dataset and explored columns using Pandas
Handled missing values using mean and mode imputation
Created visualizations: survival count, gender vs survival, age distribution
Summarized key insights clearly (presentation-ready)

Tech stack: Pandas Matplotlib Data Cleaning EDA

🏠 Project 2 — House Price Prediction

Linear Regression · Model Evaluation (RMSE, R²)

My first supervised ML model! The model learns from training data and predicts house prices on unseen test data.
What I did:

Performed train-test split to evaluate on unseen data
Trained a model using scikit-learn LinearRegression
Evaluated performance using RMSE and R² score
Visualized Actual vs Predicted values and residual errors

Tech stack: scikit-learn Linear Regression RMSE R² Matplotlib
